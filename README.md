# Message Broadcast Code Exercise

Thank you for taking the time to interview with us! 

This repository is designed to be a boilerplate to get you started with the coding exercise portion of the interview.
You'll note that we have provided the following for you:

1. The [back-end](./back-end) directory with a basic [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) template 
   
AND

2. The [front-end](./front-end) directory with a basic [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) template 

Please navigate into both of these directories and execute `npm i` to install their dependencies while you familiarize yourself with the requirements below.

## Requirement 1

You are tasked with updating the ExpressJS server in the [back-end](./back-end) directory to:

1. On start up, fetch data from url: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments) and store it in any local database (sqlite, MySQL, MongoDB).
2. Host an GET endpoint that will return the data in the Table created/loaded in #1 as a JSON array of objects.

## Requirement 2

Additionally, you will update the ReactJS application in [front-end](./front-end) directory to:

3. Host a landing/index page with your name and a button linking to the following page:
4. The second page will, on load, connect to the API from #2 in [Requirement 1](#requirement-1) to get the info stored in database and display it as an HTML Table (or Bootstrap/Material GRID for bonus points). 
5. The second page should include two buttons:
   - "Refresh" button (resend the API call from #4 and repopulate the Table)
   - "Back" button to navigate to landing page from #3.
