# Message Broadcast Code Exercise

Thank you for taking the time to interview with us!

This repository is designed to be a boilerplate to get you started with the coding exercise portion of the interview. You'll note that we have provided the following for you:

1. The [back-end](https://github.com/SuperSephy/mb-interview/tree/main/back-end) directory with a basic [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) template

AND

2. The [front-end](https://github.com/SuperSephy/mb-interview/tree/main/front-end) directory with a basic [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) template

## Set Up

Before starting, please fork, clone, or download the repository to your local machine.

Please navigate into both of these directories and execute npm i to install their dependencies while you familiarize yourself with the requirements below.
## Important Conditions

1. You are encouraged to ask questions if something is unclear, we want you to succeed!
2. You may use any publicly available source (StackOverflow, API Documentation, etc) during the exercise, but you may **NOT** use any snippets or code from previous projects.
3. We encourage making use of multiple commits to display your familiarity with Git, and easy reversion in case you'd like to change your approach.

## Requirement 1

You are tasked with updating the ExpressJS server in the back-end directory to:
1. Create a React form, that inputs: Name, Email, Address, Hobbies(checkbox), Highest Education(radio)
2. Submit that form to call Node.js express API endpoint that will save that information in any database table.

## Requirement 2

Additionally, you will update the ReactJS application in front-end directory to:

1. Node.js to expose an API that returns all the data saved by the form submission
2. React.js front-end to call that API and show the form data in an HTML Table (or Bootstrap/Material GRID for bonus points).
3. Form and view data table will be on separate tabs on React app.

## Requirment 3
1. Data present in table on react app would have two actions (Edit and Delete)
2. Both above actions will call Node API to update/delete the database in backend.

## Submission

Once you have completed the code exercise, please push the code to your own publicly accessible Git location (GitHub, GitLab, etc) and send the link to your point of contact.

Alternatively, you may create a ZIP file with your submission and send it via email, dropbox, or cloud drive to your proctor. **Please remember to remove the node_modules directories to reduce file size before sending this way**.

Done! Thank you for your interest in Message Broadcast, we look forward to reviewing your code!
